# unix-control-panel
What is this? It's a control panel to quickly do things in the terminal.<br>
How to do I use it, you ask?<br>
Well, you put the command you use to run it at the bottom of your bashrc or zshrc.<br>
This program was made to be light and customizable, feel free to edit it to your liking.<br>
If you prefer to use C, feel free to download the C version of this, as it is more lightweight (although very very buggy atm): <br>
